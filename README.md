Buzz buzz! Once you have me installed, just type 'b "<your question>"' in your terminal and I'll be there to help you out!

    🐝   $ b "How do I configure my git username?"
    🐝   $ b "How can I search for a string in a file?"
    🐝   $ b "Can you help me setup a quick webserver?"
    🐝   $ b main.cpp "I don't understand this error message. Can you help?"
    🐝   $ b "Show me how to spawn a new thread in {favorite language}."

👉 I'll give you answers -- plus code you can copy or run immediately. Press
 X to execute and C to copy. Use WASD to navigate.
👉 Press Q to quit -- then type 'b' with no arguments to see my last reply again.

👉 If you want to use GPT-4, just type b4 instead of b!
    🐝   $ b4 "HELP ME! What is this gnarly C++ error message? :("
        Then I'll be even smarter! (Requires GPT-4 API Access)
👉 Just so you know, I can 👀see your:
    - bash session history
    - git repo status
    - system clipboard contents
    - any file you pass me by typing 'b file.name'
    (OpenAI sees this too 🤔)
   But all this information really helps me out! 😃

👉 More ways to use me:
   - 'b' to see my last reply
   - 'bee' to use your $EDITOR to ask your question.
       Then bash won't get in the way!
       (Stuck in vim? Ask me how to configure your $EDITOR)
   - 'bemoji tree'
       I can help you search for an emoji!🌼🌸💐🏵️
   - 'bwrite public/reset.css'
       I can quickly prototype files for you!
   - 'ps aux --sort=%mem | b "What's using all my memory?"'
       Pipe any command to me to get a quick explanation.
   - './configure || b4 "What do I need to install? Use sudo." | grep "sudo apt"'
       Use b in your automation scripts!
👉 If you want to configure me, open up this file: bconfig.py.
    You can change colors, change the keymap, even write your own plugins!

👉 For more options, type 'b --help'

🐝 Have fun coding! 🐝
