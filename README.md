Buzz buzz! Once you have me installed, just type 'b "<your question>"' in your terminal and I'll be there to help you out!

    🐝   $ b "How do I configure my git username?"
    🐝   $ b "How can I search for a string in a file?"
    🐝   $ b "Can you help me setup a quick webserver?"
    🐝   $ b main.cpp "I don't understand this error message. Can you help?"
    🐝   $ b "Show me how to spawn a new thread in {favorite language}."

👉 I'll give you answers -- plus code you can copy or run immediately. Press x to execute and y to copy. Use WASD to navigate.
👉 Press q to quit -- then type 'b' with no arguments to see my last reply again.

👉 If you want to use GPT-4, just type b4 instead of b!
    🐝   $ b4 "Help me with this horrible C++ error message."
        Then I'll be even smarter! (Requires GPT-4 API Access)
👉 Just so you know, I can 👀see your:
    - bash session history
    - git repo status
    - system clipboard contents
    - any file you pass me by typing 'b file.name'
   All this information really helps me out! 😃


👉 More ways to use me: 
    - Just 'b' to see my last reply
    - 'bee' to use your $EDITOR to ask your question
        Then bash won't get in the way!
