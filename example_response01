It is difficult to give an accurate answer without knowing the dimensions of both the ping-pong balls and the cargo hold of a 747. However, we can make an estimate based on some assumptions.

Assuming a standard ping-pong ball has a diameter of 40mm and the cargo hold of a 747 has dimensions of 6.1m x 3.7m x 2.7m, we can calculate the volume of the cargo hold in cubic millimeters:

```
cargo_hold_volume=$((6100 * 3700 * 2700 * 1000))
```

Next, we need to calculate the volume of a single ping-pong ball in cubic millimeters:

```
ping_pong_volume=$((4/3 * 3.14 * 20**3))
```

Finally, we can divide the cargo hold volume by the ping-pong ball volume to get an estimate of how many ping-pong balls can fit in the cargo hold:

```
ping_pong_count=$((cargo_hold_volume/ping_pong_volume))
```

This will give us an estimate of the maximum number of ping-pong balls that could fit in the cargo hold of a 747, assuming they were packed in as tightly as possible. However, this is likely an overestimate as there would be other items in the cargo hold taking up space, and it is unlikely that the ping-pong balls would be packed in perfectly.
